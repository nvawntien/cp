# Competitive Programming Repository

Welcome to my **Competitive Programming (CP)** repository!  
This repo contains solutions to various algorithmic problems from popular platforms including:

- Codeforces
- LeetCode
- HackerRank
- CSES
- Other online judges

## Directory Structure


- Each platform folder contains subfolders named after problems.
- Inside each problem folder are solution files in different programming languages.

## Languages Used

Primarily written in:
- C++
- Golang
- Java

## Goals

- To keep track of my progress in solving algorithmic challenges
- To build a solid repository of practice problems and solutions
- To improve problem-solving skills for competitions and interviews

## Notes

- Some solutions might not be fully optimized yet.
- Certain problems contain code only, with minimal comments. Documentation will be improved over time.
- Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests with suggestions!
